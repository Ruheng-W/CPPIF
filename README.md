# CPPIF: A multi-objective comprehensive framework for predicting protein-peptide interactions and binding residues

In this work, we developed a multi-objective comprehensive framework, called CPPIF, to predict both binary protein-peptide interaction and their binding residues. We also constructed a benchmark dataset containing more than 8,900 protein-peptide interacting pairs with non-covalent interactions and their corresponding binding residues to systematically evaluate the performances of existing models. Comprehensive evaluation on the benchmark datasets demonstrated that CPPIF can successfully predict the non-covalent protein-peptide interactions that cannot be effectively captured by previous prediction methods. Moreover, CPPIF outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in predicting binding residues in the peptides and achieved good performance in the identification of important binding residues in the proteins.
